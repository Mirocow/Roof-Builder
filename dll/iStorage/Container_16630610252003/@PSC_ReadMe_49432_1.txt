Title: Container Speed Testing - Hash, Array, Direct, List, Dictionary, Collection, Recordset
Description: There's many different ways to store data in VB. This application tests a few of them. You shouldn't blindly choose the method that has the highest numbers! You should choose a method based on the usage pattern of your data. For instance, even though the timings say 'clsDirect' is fastest, for my application, a combination of clsHash and clsList proved to work 50% faster. If you don't know which method is best, try them all - they all implement interface IContainer, and swapping out one for another is a simple one-line code change.
